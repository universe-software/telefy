# Telefy

A general purpose internet communications app for chat, forums, message boards, etc.

It uses peer-to-peer communication technology with no need for a centralized service or accounts, and instead uses OpenPGP keys and signatures to identify users.

While it currently only supports text-based communication, an advanced video and audio meetings feature is coming soon.
